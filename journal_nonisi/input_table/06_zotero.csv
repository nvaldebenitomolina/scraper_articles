In this work we study the potential benefits of applying a succinct data re-organization of a tetrahedral data-parallel domain of size O(n3) combined with an efficient block-space GPU map of the form g (λ) : N → N3. Results from the analysis suggest that in theory the combination of these two optimizations produce significant performance improvement as block-based data reorganization allows a coalesced one-to-one correspondence at local thread-space while g(λ) produces an efficient block-space spatial correspondence between groups of data and groups of threads, reducing the number of unnecessary threads from O(n3) to O(n2ρ3) with ρ ϵ O(1). From the analysis, we obtained that a block based succinct data re-organization can provide up to 2× improved performance over a linear data organization while the map can be up to 6× more efficient than a bounding box approach. The results from this work can serve as a useful guide for a more efficient GPU computation on tetrahedral domains found in spin lattice, finite element and special n-body problems, among others.",2016-10,2018-06-05 14:08:16,2018-06-05 14:08:39,2018-06-05 14:08:16,1-5,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE,,,,,,,Crossref,,,,,,Ciudades Resilientes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, interventions in this domain risk failure if they do not explicitly address the particular socio-cultural traits of the deployment scenario. This is the case in most countries of Latin America, where computing has not reached a sustainable penetration in K-12 education. In order to bridge this gap, we designed a one-week workshop for advancing computational thinking targeted to 10-12 years old Chilean students with no prior experience in programming. This paper describes our intervention and presents the results of a qualitative study analyzing positive and negative aspects of the experience. Although most participants effectively acquired basic programming skills by the end of the intervention, we also identified several inaccurate views on computing and computer scientists. For instance, computing was mostly perceived as a set of informal experiences rather than a way for enabling creation, automation, and work. The word ""hacking"" appears to be used as a metaphor for more technical terms, such as ""programming"" or ""algorithm"". Finally, negative stereotypical views of computer scientists resulting from the intervention were not as frequent as initial perceptions. These results provide fresh evidence on how to design, adapt, and evaluate computational thinking interventions targeted to K-6 students in Latin America.",2018,2018-06-04 20:57:02,2018-06-04 20:57:52,2018-06-04 20:57:02,993-998,,,,,,Coding or Hacking?,,,,,ACM Press,,en,,,,,Crossref,,,,,,Ciudades Resilientes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In part, this is because there are strong cultural stereotypes about what careers are ""for men"" in Chile. This idea has been further cemented by the standardized admissions process used by Chilean universities, where female mathematics scores have historically been lower than that of their male peers. In order to break these stereotypes and attract more women into STEM careers, the Faculty of Mathematical and Physical Sciences at the University of Chile has created the Gender Equality Admissions Program (PEG, for its name in Spanish, Programa de Ingreso Prioritario de Equidad de Génera) in 2013. Under this program, 40 extra women are selected into the most competitive engineering and science program in the country. In the five years that the PEG has been in place, the number of women accepted into the engineering and science program has grown from 19% to more than 32%. Moreover, we have started to see an increase in the enrollment of female students in Software Engineering courses. This growth goes beyond the 40 new female students per year.",2018,2018-09-12 13:39:03,2018-09-25 15:04:23,2018-09-12 13:39:03,45-48,,,Part F137812,,,,,,,,ACM Press,"Gothenburg, Sweden",en,,,,,Crossref,,,,,,Ciudades Resilientes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,the 1st International Workshop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is considerable less research on how to effectively deliver software development skills in a way that can be accepted and ultimately adopted by this user group. As a way to bridge this gap, we ran an extracurricular project-based workshop, targeting 10-12 years old learners with no prior coding experience, delivered over five days in the computer labs at the University of Chile. In this workshop, participants follow hands-on activities where they acquire the basics of computer programming and develop a small-scale software application using Scratch. These activities showcase that good software engineering practices can be taught to K-6 students, where these students are guided by experienced computer science undergraduate and graduate students. This paper presents a descriptive case study that focuses on assessing how K-6 learners assimilate and use these practices when developing their first computing application in a non-traditional learning experience. In order to do this, we designed and calibrated a rubric to evaluate the software products generated by the workshop participants. Our findings provide further evidence that it is indeed possible to teach initial notions of software engineering to this user group, structuring these constructs in a non-technical language that can be assimilated by novice developers. Furthermore, we did not observe significant differences in this matter according to gender and socio-economic status.",2018,2018-09-25 14:56:32,2018-09-25 14:58:39,2018-09-25 14:56:32,98-107,,,,,,,,,,,ACM Press,"Gothenburg, Sweden",en,,,,,Crossref,,,,,,Ciudades Resilientes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,the 40th International Conference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Traffic congestions are still a problem in cities and are one of the main cause for public transport delays. City residents and visitors have experienced time loss by using public transport buses, because of waiting at the bus stops and not knowing if the bus is delayed or already serviced the stop. Therefore it is valuable for people to know at what time the bus should arrive (or is it already missed) at specific bus stop. Real-time public bus tracking and management system development has been the focus of many researchers, and many studies have been done in this area. This paper focuses on bus travel time prediction comparison between linear regression and support vector regression models (SVR), when using limited data set. Data were limited in a way that only historical GPS (Global Positioning System) coordinates of bus location (recorded each 30 seconds) and driven distance were used, there were no information about arrival/departure times, delays or dwell times. Distance between stops and delay (assumed values based on route observations by authors) were used as inputs for both models. It was concluded that SVR algorithm showed better results, but the difference was not significantly large. Copyright © 2018 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

QDCT42JR,journalArticle,2018,"Deudero, Irene Repeto; González, Susana Gómez; Copete, Fernando Ojeda",DROSOPHYLLUM LUSITANICUM A,,,,,,"Drosophyllum lusitanicum (Drosophyllaceae) is a carnivorous plant endemic to the Mediterranean heathland of the western Iberian Peninsula and northern Africa (herriza), particularly present in Portugal and Spain (mainly in the Strait of Gibraltar region). Its geographic rarity (endemism), ecological rarity (carnivory) and taxonomic rarity (monotypic family) make of this species the epitome of plant singularity of the herriza. Land use changes in the last century have transformed the herriza, compromising the conservation status of Drosophyllum. In this study, we have compiled herbarium records of this species since the end of the XIX century obtained from GBIF (http://www.gbif. es), Anthos (http://www.anthos.es) and Flora-On (http://flora-on.pt) databases in order to detect temporal variations in the presence of Drosophyllum in natural and anthropogenic habitats in Spain and Portugal. Both countries showed contrasting patterns: while most Drosophyllum sites in Portugal were anthropogenic habitats, natural heathland habitats were frequent in Spain. We detected a marked increase of anthropogenic habitats in the two regions from 1950 onwards. Results allow us to suggest that viability of Drosophyllum populations would be compromised in Portugal, being the Spanish side of the Strait of Gibraltar region a critical refuge area for the conservation of this unique species.",2018,2019-08-12 15:28:59,2019-08-12 15:28:59,,19,,,,,,,,,,,,,es,,,,,Zotero,,,,/home/nvaldebenito/Zotero/storage/9TU6UGCC/Deudero et al. - 2018 - DROSOPHYLLUM LUSITANICUM A.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
